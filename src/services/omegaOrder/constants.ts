 * where they are, so a user keeps the active membership of the order they got it in.
 *
 * The rest are migrated one group at a time by someone picking which members carry over, through
 * that group type's own migration operation. Omega cannot increment again until they have all
 * caught up - see `omegaOrderOperations.readRequirements`.
