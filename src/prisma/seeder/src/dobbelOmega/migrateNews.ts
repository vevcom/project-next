 * WARNING: The text formatting is still bad, and needs to be fixed. Omegaweb-basic stored

 * left empty - editing a migrated article in the CMS therefore starts from a blank
 * markdown source.
 *
 * Migrates Omegaweb-basic Articles to PN NewsArticles (each wrapping an Article with a
 * cover image and one body section). The old lead becomes the news article's description,
 * which is what the news list renders on each card, and the old text becomes the single
 * article section.
 *
 * InfoPages are deliberately not migrated. They were reviewed one by one and the outcome
 * was that almost none of them should come across as-is:
 *  * forside, for bedrifter, hytte: rewritten in the seeder instead
 *  * guider, om omega: seeded as standard article categories
 *  * interessegrupper, omegafond, jobbannonser: junk or replaced by real PN features
 *  * komiteer: migrateCommittees covers this
 * What is left is two conflicting prikkreglement and one notice with a broken image, so
 * the remainder is copied over by hand rather than by script.
 *
 * @param pnPrisma - PrismaClientPn
 * @param owPrisma - PrismaClientOw

 * @param limits - Limits - used to limit the number of articles to migrate
