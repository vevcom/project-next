/**
 * The authorizer every group type's `readMembers` uses. Reading a group's members hands out the
 * users behind the memberships, so it takes permission to read users on top of permission to read
 * the group type itself - a group type's own read permission is not enough on its own.
 *
 * `CLASS_READ` and `MANUAL_GROUP_READ` are default permissions (seeded in development by `seedDevPermissions.ts`), and
 * `ServerSession.fromNextAuth` falls back to the default permissions when there is no session, so a
 * `readMembers` gated on one of those alone is callable by a visitor who is not logged in at all.
 *
 * `USERS_READ` is a membership permission, so for the group types whose own read permission is a
 * membership permission too this adds nothing - which is the point. The rule holds for every type
 * rather than being a patch on the two that need it, so a group type that is made readable by
 * default later cannot start handing out member data by doing so.

/**
 * The `readMembers` authorizer for the group types someone administers by hand - committees,

 *
 * `RequirePermissionOrGroupAdmin` lets a group's own admin add, remove and retitle its members
 * without holding the group type's admin permission. Gating the member list on permissions alone
 * would leave that admin managing a group whose members they may not see - and the pages that offer
 * the management read the members first, so they would be turned away before reaching it. An active
 * admin membership therefore passes here too.
 *
 * The permission arm is unchanged from `requireReadGroupMembers`, so nothing that could read a
 * group's members before can read less now. Group types nobody administers this way - classes and
 * omega membership groups, whose membership is decided elsewhere - keep the plain authorizer, so a
 * default read permission still cannot hand out a roster to a visitor.
